# Ship Classes


## Ship Categories
There are actually 4 different "categories" of ships: Military, Technological/Civilian [Note: Technological piggybacks off of civilian, because it is not a big enough category on it's own), Industrial, and Scientific. These are most likely just going to be four species that's ship's look like they're focused on such categories.

_Military_: Camouflage, Menacing and Reassuring at the same time, weaponized. All ship classes.

_Technological/Civilian_: Mostly Normal Sized, except technological will have some satellite dishes, etc. Technological: Drone, Destroyer, Battleship, Battlecruiser | Civilian: Shuttle, Fighter, Corvette, Frigate, Cruiser, Carrier, Capital, Titan

_Scientific_: Meant to like highly efficient and "science-y". Shuttle-Frigate, Cruiser, Capital [Neglecting Destroyer, Battleship, Battlecruiser, and Carrier]

_Industrial_: Ships are larger than most of the other category's ships. Shuttle-Frigate, Cruiser-Titan [Neglecting Destroyer, Battleship, and Battlecruiser]

## Ship Classes:
  - Shuttle  | Will have for each race 3 size classes, Small fitting 1-2 people, Medium fitting 8-16 people, and Large fitting 450+ people (Note: No 4 different "categories" for the shuttle, every species should have one)

  - Drone | No huge size differences except for what you'd expect, Science being small, compact, and chock full of use, Technological being small, and sneakily hacking looking, Military being a bit larger than normal, and Industrial being the largest.

  - Fighter | This is obvious for the military. For the Industrial, it is meant to be a sentry/guard's ship, but still looks as though it could be used for mining, Civilian, a couple of weapons, nice looking. Science looking protective, but still "science-y"

  - Corvette | This is the speedster for most of the "categories", but it is a test ship in the science, and a mini-drone carrier in the industrial category.
  
  - Frigate | This is the most popular large ship used by almost any, and also being the most common ship (besides maybe the fighter). Probably most often used in the industrial (where it's the most often used cargo ship), it is used in the science category as a mini-hq, and in military, it is still a "military" ship.
  
  - Destroyer | Only used in the military and technological areas. In the military it is meant to be fast, and hit hard. Early-Combat, Heavy Weapons, fast, medium armor, a little bit larger than the frigate, but not as large as a battleship. In the tech area it is meant to be a destroyer outfitted with jamming, and superior drone control abilities.
  
  - Battleship | Once again, only used by military and tech. Military, it is meant to have huge weapons, heavy armor, and speed isn't too much of a concern, quite a bit larger than a destroyer, at a 2/1 ratio (double the size). Tech it is meant to be another hacking ship (tech tends to be pretty repetitive)
  
  - Battlecruiser | The last ship only used by the military and tech categories. In military, it is meant to be extremely well armored, and in the tech, it is a fleet jumper, it allows for a fleet to jump using only it's super powerful jump drive, which is like a ring that affects the exterior of the ship it's so large (Think of that one capital ship you made, the 3d one...). This allows for ships lacking jump drives such as fighters and other crafts (Anything lower than the battlecruiser besides the science corvette and frigate)
  
  - Cruiser | This ship is the nice and large yacht, the one that doesn't seem overboard for a pretty wealthy person to have. In the military, it serves as a relatively large ship that sometimes leads fleets. Scientifically, it is a huge testing lab full of greenhouses, labs, etc. In the Industry, it's a transport vessel, and for the civilian's, it's a really nice yacht, so don't forget that.
  
  - Carrier | The Civilian Carrier is a carrier that takes people to different systems. Since most ships that non-rich civilians have are in-capable of inter-system travel, they hop on the jump-drive bus ;). In the Military, this is obvious. In the science area, it carries scientific probes and vessels (science frigates and under sizewise). Industrially, it is a large scale drone carrier for mining.
  
  - Capital | This is the largest ship that most people will have. The Military Version is simply a giant command ship that is a combination of most of the other classes before it. Scientifically, it's a big HQ. For the civilian version, it's a giant floating hotel. Some of the richest simply use it as a mega-gigantic yacht-palace ship. Industrially, it's a huge transport, with drone capacity, and also has some small compartments hidden for smuggling.

The next ship is set apart because it is difficult to describe in such a small space, and it has very customized, and still plenty more of customize-able space.

Now presenting the........

***TITAN***:
  
  MILITARY: In the military, this ship is the mother of all ships. The largest ship in the game, it is 100x bigger than the military capital ship, and 3x bigger than the second-largest Titan (the Industry Titan). This Titan has super-heavy armor, the most heavy armor in the game, and has the most turrets/weapons in the game by far. It has a super-weapon on it, which can destroy planets (#starwars is awesome). It can also carry a HUMONGOUS amount of fighters, and could, if smashed in it's hangar, carry about 45 military capital ships. Wut???????!?

  SCIENCE: This ship, made to be a special ship for science reasons, can slingshot vessels across almost 100 star systems, while it is meant to send out probes, it can send a ship with people onboard too. It is of decent size, not being the smallest Titan, but it is the second smallest.

  INDUSTRY: This is the second largest Titan, being an I-Can-Do-It-All kind of ship, it basically is a super-ship for mining, and transporting goods. It doesn't have the best armorments, and should generally have some protection.

  CIVILIAN: This is the smallest Titan, but it is definitely so huge, that you would not expect someone to own it for just themselves. Made to be a literal space-hotel on rocket-engines, this ship once fully upgraded can hold 250,000 people total in it's habitation modules (crew and passengers). Pretty good defense systems, so could maybe survive in the universe on it's own with a full crew that is worthy to run such a ship.
