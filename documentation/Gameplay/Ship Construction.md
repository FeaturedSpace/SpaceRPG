# SpaceRPG Gameplay: Ship Construction
Eventually, some ORGs will have the resources and the need to construct their own ships and ship parts. Most of the time, in a need for war.

## Steps
First, the ORG must build it's own station, specifically, a Ship Construction Facility. Then, they must upgrade and fit it so that it has the ability to produce the type(s) of ship(s) that they require. Then, they must procure the materials necessary, and turn those into ship parts using a facility of their own, or another's. Now they can begin crafting ships. Of course, the ORG must also own one or more hangars to store these ships. But that isn't directly releated to producing them, so we don't cover that in this document.

## The Cost of Such a Station
There are two different direct variables that the ORG can affect. Size, and Tech Level. These two variables will determine the Station's ability to produce certain types of ships, and in a certain amount of time, and cost, etc. Max Tech Level is 10, and Max Size is 15.

Here is the Direct Equation for such Calculations:
c = 10^8 + 10 * s^t

In English:
Cost = One Million + 10 Times the Size to the Power of the Tech Level.
