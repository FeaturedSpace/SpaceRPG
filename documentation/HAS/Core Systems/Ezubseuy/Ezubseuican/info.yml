  Description: >
    The Ezubseuicans are a cute little species, though not as strong or intelligent as some other speices, the Ezubseuicans are
    well known for being extremely persuasive, and having an extreme amount of charm. They are very, very cute, and can even
    seduce some other species.
    
    The Ezubseuicans have no religion, and their beliefs are very wide, and their is really no official religion of their species.
    They believe that all species deserve to be treated fairly, no matter what size. This was really their ideal only after first 
    contact with other species, because some species would consider them to be dumb enough to be kept as house pets, and, as you 
    might imagine, the Ezubseuicans weren't to happy about that.
  History: >
    Almost no history has been recorded by the Ezubseuicans. They believe that the present is all that matters.
