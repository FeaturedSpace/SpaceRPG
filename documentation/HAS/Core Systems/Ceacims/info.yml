    Structure: > "The Ceacim are a range of blues/greens/purples and have very dense, but thin leathery skin due to the extreme cold on their planet. 
     They have three legs for movement with dome shaped feet. They have two arms with seven fingers for the same use humans have. 
     They have anywhere from five to nine antennae where a humans head would be that can 'see' through a mixture of sensing the pull 
     of gravity and feeling vibrations (though not quite hearing) through a sort of echo-location. For communication, they have 
     two spheres that fluxuate which other Ceacim can interpret as many different things. Throughout their entire body, though 
     especially on their hands and near their 'com spheres', you can see glowing 'veins' that not only transport bromine 
     (their version of our oxygen) but hold their nervous system (including thinking, which explains why they're dumb)."
