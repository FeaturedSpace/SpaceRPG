     Meagdites are small, upright reptillian creatures with a 'head' that looks similair to a triceratops. They are green with 
     red/blue/purple scales, which sometimes can be used to determine rank in society. Meagdites have six appendages which can be 
     used to crawl (extremely fast) and grab. They dont have eyes, but have small pores all over their body that let them see 
     pretty much in every direction. They can hear through the pads in their feet and have an amazing sense of smell (using a 
     hole on their 'stomach') which lets them sense almost any chemical compound. Meagdites have what could be considered a mouth 
     near their hole for smelling. They insert the meat and food into the slit and almost immediately digest it. They have many 
     ways of cooling themselves, (for they live much closer to the sun than humans) the most prominent being the liquid chlorine 
     that can be dispersed throughout their 'circulatory system'.

  Description: >
    The Meagdites have had the abilty of space travel for around a thousand years, but have never had the interest to go outside
    of their system and develop the technology to. Recently though (due to their near future depleation of resourses and the new
    appearance of humans in the galaxy) scientists have started to develop a inter-system spaceship and may succeed soon. They
    have lived a fairly peaceful existence in the Dioscuri(?) System, developing, colonizing, and establishing steady populations
    on every possible planet. The Meagdites have a central government called The 'Rational Fascist Coalation' that gives large 
    amounts of freedom to providences (large sections of land on each planet) to do what they want law-wise. They find 
    freedom-of-state extremely important so that the right laws impact the right areas. The Meagdites do not necessarily worship
    gods, but some do have different theories about how gods created the universe. They have a dense culture, though not quite as
    dense as humans, that includes things like 'smell music', a mixture of odors made by certain people that change. (They
    consider this art)
