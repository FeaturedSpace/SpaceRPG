      Qa's are very strong and furry creatures, resembling large bears. They are also vey tall. Their fur is soft when they are 
      emotional, but when they are in battle, their fur hardens to sort of protect them in a way. Their eyes often reflect their 
      current emotion in shape and color.

  Description: >
    The Ebuccats do not have fast as light travel, but can go where ever their portals let them go. They inhabit a few solar systems,
    (including the one with the Ebbucat species) but are having trouble getting the portals any farther. The Ebuccats as a society are
    obsessed with the making of psychedelics and drugs to expand their mind and conscious. The most widespread drug is called 
    Vaneelaa, but other drugs mostly depend on what planet you're on. For religion, each Ebbucat has their own 'spirit creature' which
    guides them through their life, kind of like a conscious.
  History:
    - "Vaneelaa Discovery"
    - "First Successful Travel by Portal"
