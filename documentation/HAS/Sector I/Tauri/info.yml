  Description: >
    Taurian (home planet of the Tauri species) and the society that exists on it are somewhat dystopian by human standards. Ruled by
    corrupt and nepotistic leaders, Taurian is home to thousands of cities- most of which are infested with ghetto-like slums. From the 
    moment they can speak, young Tauri are subjected to intense brainwashing by means of biased, insufficient education and state-
    controlled media. As a result, the vast majority of the Tauri race is ignorant, misinformed, and highly suspicious of outsiders.      
  History: >
    The early history of the Tauri species is familiar. As their population grew, the ancient Tauri shifted into a new way of life. They 
    changed from nomadic hunter-gatherers into organized societies with laws and jobs. As centuries passed, these societies invented new
    tools and developed ideas that could potentially improve the quality of life for the common Tauri. However, fearing that knowledge
    and the well-being of their subjects would lead to rebellion and protest, Tauri aristocrats and monarchs established the Council of 
    Nobles. This Council united the Tauran Kingdoms into one empire and organized legions of soldiers to suppress the discontent of the 
    people through force and violence. The Council also made sure to keep the masses uneducated and knowledge-deprived. Even to this day, 
    only members of the Council of Nobles (around 4% of the entire Tauran population) are granted modern knowledge and education. The other 
    96% are practically living in the Middle Ages, even as the Council's engineers build spacecraft capable of reaching the speed of 
    light. For the past two hundred years, differences in religious beliefs within the Council has divided it into two factions- Neaeto and 
    Meaeka. These two groups are locked in a constant power struggle, with the highest-ranking member of the majority faction being the 
    emperor of the entire Tauran Empire.
