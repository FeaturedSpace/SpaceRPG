  Description: >
    The Ezrulians are supposed to have been around longer than any other known species, having existed for thousands of Millennium. 
    They worship a good called Iku. They generally believe that Iku is the universe. This is where they get their 'enviromentalism' 
    charactaristics. They believe the sole purpose of life is to tend to Iku's needs.
    
    They always avoid, however, using Iku to explain science, or strange or supernatural events. Their reason for believe in Iku
    is because they believe that Iku controls Worthiness, and Purpose. They use him as a 'personality-why' They worship him through
    their sun, Ezo. They believe that their sun was created in an ultimate image of Iku.
    
    They have been closely observing developing species, such as the Humans in Sol, and are trying to learn more about why (purpose)
    Iku decided to create life in the universe.
  History: >
    Not much is known about Ezrulian history, but we do know that a couple hundred Millennium ago, an Ezrulian who called himself,
    "Izo" came and fored a group called the "Dezrulians" This group was focused on Iku, and being majorly composed of theologians.
    Izo claimed that he was immune to any control that Iku could have over him, and that Iku was actually an excuse with no purpose
    himself.
