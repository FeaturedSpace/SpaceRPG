      7-10 skinny, dangling appendages (with 4 or five fingers each) that will stiffen to support their weight. They can see with eyes, 
      eat/taste with their mouth, and hear with a pad around their 'torso' above their appendages.

  Description: >
    The Ebuccats do not have fast as light travel, but can go where ever their portals let them go. They inhabit a few solar systems,
    (including the one with the _____ species) but are having trouble getting the portals any farther. The Ebuccats as a society are
    obsessed with the making of psychedelics and drugs to expand their mind and conscious. The most widespread drug is called 
    Vaneelaa, but other drugs mostly depend on what planet you're on. For religion, each Ebbucat has their own 'spirit creature' which
    guides them through their life, kind of like a conscious.
