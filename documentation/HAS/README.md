The HAS territory is still mostly speculative, because of size, and even now, some scientists are hinting that there may be signs that the galaxy may actually have two HASs, with a buffer zone in between them that spans across the galaxy's diameter.

The Known HAS is supossed to be about 1/4 of the galaxy, and from the perspective of most maps, on the bottom left corner of the galaxy.
