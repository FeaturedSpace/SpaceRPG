# The Known HAS (HAbitable Sector [of the galaxy])

The HAS is the HAbitable Sector of the galaxy, containing all of the all of the proper charactaristics and phenomenon to produce stable systems that are capable of life. Scientists on Earth are actually speculating that there may be more to HAS than we currently know.

The HAS territory is still mostly speculative, because of size, and even now, some scientists are hinting that there may be signs that the galaxy may actually have two HASs, with a buffer zone in between them that spans across the galaxy's diameter.

The Known HAS is supossed to be about 1/4 of the galaxy, and from the perspective of most maps, on the bottom left corner of the galaxy. Scientists speculate that the Known HAS probably contains about 25 billion systems. It has a trapezoid-like shape, being sallets at it's clossest range to the center of the galaxy, and largest when furthest away.

### Note:
Gameplay in SpaceRPG will take place in the center of the part of the Known HAS. As the game progresses, players will explore and disconver new species, while naming star systems for themselves (as well as planets, and sometimes species). The game, however, should not have a forcefull exploration feel. SpaceRPG's Known HAS is simply to prevent a feeling of complete impossibleness for exploration, as well as to shrink down the galaxy to more of a "Known Galaxy" to make the game more comfortable and easing to play.

### Also:
We will still have to make sure the HAS is extremely versatile, with lots of procedural generaration, as well as a well designed layout for that procedural generation. We need to make sure no planet looks alike.
