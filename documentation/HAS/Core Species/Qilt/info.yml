  Description: >
   Almost the entire Qilt population are bent on one thing: building life and playing god. Tekathy, their religion based off of 
   a book called "Tekath's Prophecy" states that the sole purpose of every Qilt is to help in the creation of new life (and i'm 
   not talking about reproduction). According to the book, each Qilt successful in creating life becomes a god. This has prevented 
   them from inter-system travel, though there is a small rebellion of Qilt that have been trying to escape Tekathy's tyranny 
   (for the religion has been law for quite some time) and travel to other systems. The Qilt live on a very cold planet (hence 
   the hair) and technology is almost advanced as humans, but old ways and Tekathy have held them back
  History:
    - "Rebellion Successfully Destroys Years of Research on Life"
    - "Takath's Prophecy is Widely Available Thanks to a Qilt Version of the Printing Press"
