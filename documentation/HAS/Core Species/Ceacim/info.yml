      The Ceacim are a range of blues/purples and have very dense, but thin leathery skin due to the extreme 
      cold on their planet. They have three legs for movement with dome shaped feet. They have two arms with seven fingers for the 
      same use humans have. They have anywhere from five to nine antennae where a humans head would be that can 'see' through a 
      mixture of sensing the pull of gravity and feeling vibrations (though not quite hearing) through a sort of echo-location. 
      For communication (where their shoulders would be) they have two spheres/nubs that fluxuate which other Ceacim can interpret 
      as many different things. Throughout their entire body, though especially on their hands, antennae near their 'com spheres', 
      you can see glowing 'veins' that not only transport bromine (their version of our oxygen) but hold their nervous system 
      (including thinking, which explains why they're not very intelligence).

  Description: > 
    The Ceacim species have been around for a fairly short amount of time compared to other life on their planet 
    Storth (though not as short as humans). They are used to very cold temperatures but could adapt very fast to warmer 
    environments due to their access to a version of RNA editing. They are not too intelligent but not so dumb they cannot function 
    effectivly. (Think of the dumbest person you know (without a mental disease). That is about how intelligent they are.) Some of 
    the Ceacim have been in a agrarian state for some thousands of years and some for only hundreds. Without the assistance of 
    other species, they are expected to reach space in another few thousand years. Most Ceacim tribes take religion seriously, but 
    not to the extent that other species take it. The largest tribe, the Wamnn, which consists of somewhere from 60,000 to 90,000 
    Ceacim, practice the the teachings of the Erosons Oracles. The Erosons Oracles is based off a book (written with a sort of 
    brail) that states how their world was created and the demands of Eroson, their god. The book was created by eight Ceacim named
    the Disciples of Eroson.
