  Description: >
    The Improbusi are a species that believes that money is everything. They worship a god called Lok, who just so happens to
    represent money and power. They claim that Lok says that they are the rightful rulers of the universe, and that anyone else
    with any control is an imposter and must be 'eliminated'. Beneficially, Lok teaches that the deal is the most important thing,
    so they only resort to murder, kidnapping, and other galaxy-wide felonies as a last resort. They are kind-of ugly, but still
    manage to charm people during their deal process.
  History: >
    In 2432, the Improbusi species was discovered by humans, and that was when Lok turned from their world was rightfully theirs to
    the galaxy being rightfully theirs. This transition led to several inscriptions about how the humans (and other intergalactic 
    species) were evil, and didn't even deserve to dwell in the galaxy.
