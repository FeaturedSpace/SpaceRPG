  Description: >
    The Laikanins are a cute little species, though not as strong or intelligent as some other speices, the Laikanins are
    well known for being extremely persuasive, and having an extreme amount of charm. They are very, very cute, and can even
    seduce some other species.
    
    The Laikanins have no religion, and their beliefs are very wide, and their is really no official religion of their species.
    They believe that all species deserve to be treated fairly, no matter what size. This was really their ideal only after first 
    contact with other species, because some species would consider them to be dumb enough to be kept as house pets, and, as you 
    might imagine, the Laikanins weren't to happy about that.
  History: >
    Almost no history has been recorded by the Lakanins. The only recorded data on Laikanins is that they all share two common ancestors
    Laika the first dog sent to space by humans, and Albert the first monkey sent to space by humans, With no way to bring either
    animals back Laika and Albert stood alone on the human space station together, the offspring of the two created Laikanins which escaped 
    the space station and found a planet to call home (Noah please change this backstory someday)
