  Description: >
    The Paeztip are the most humanoid species in the Core Sector Besides Earth (duh), and they are pretty much just like Humans, 
    except for their interesting and beyond the average Human's strength. They also are extremely slow to evolve, and hate change.
    It's almost like it's one of their core traits to hate change, and other things that they have no experience with before.
  History:
    - "Had a War About Change"
    - "First Contact War with Humanity"
    - "10 Year Long Peace Negotiations"
    - "Strong Relationship with Humanity Now"
